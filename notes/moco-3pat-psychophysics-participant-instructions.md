# Participant Instructions
### moco-3-pattern-psychophysics


## Camera Location
- The camera should be located to the right of the computer taking a side view of the participant and the monitor.
  - since this is a wide angle lens, the monitor can be seen on the camera view 

## Light Location
- Place the light underneath the desk. Ensure it is bright enough that the video can be seen, but dark enough that the participant does not have any difficulty viewing the display.
- Light level 100% with 3 light bars is enough that the fixation dot may be seen on the monitor

## Participant Location
1. Have the participant sit in the chair in front of the monitor. Raise or lower the chair as necessary.
2. If the participant is very fidgety, use a chair without wheels.
3. The participant should be seated 60 cm from the monitor

## Participant Age
- 4 year olds are too young for this study.
- 5-8 year olds will point or verbalize which image they choose
- adults will use the keyboard input

## Participant Instructions

We will have 4 groups of images to look at. We will take a break half way through the study.
In the beginning there will be a few screens that we will see. Please press the space bar or 6/Right Thumb key after each of these. First there will be a welcome screen, followed by a psychtoolbox screeen and finally a blank screen. Then you will be ready to start. You will look for which picture moves up/down or in/out. We will do a short practice so that you understand what to look for.

### Keyboard Input

1. Please look at the screen and focus on the dot in the middle of the screen. Use your peripheral vision to determine which image (Left or Right) has an up/down or in/out pattern to the movement of the dots.
2. Press the 'z' button with your left pointer finger if the left image has a pattern of movement
3. Press the '?' button with your right pointer finger if the right image has a pattern of movement
4. Press the space bar 2 times in between dot images

### Game Controller Input

1. Please look at the screen and focus on the dot in the middle of the screen. Use your peripheral vision to determine which image (Left or Right) has an up/down or in/out pattern to the movement of the dots.
2. Press the left 2 button with your left pointer finger if the left image has a pattern of movement
3. Press the right 2 button with your right pointer finger if the right image has a pattern of movement
4. Press the 6 key 2 times in between dot images

### Pointing/Verbal Input

1. Today you will not be using the keyboard, mouse or game controller.
2. Please look at the screen and focus on the dot in the middle of the screen. Then determine which image (Left or Right) has an up/down or in/out pattern to the movement of the dots.
3. Point to the left image or say 'left' if the left image moves up/down or in/out.
4. Point to the right image or say 'right' if the right image moves up/down or in/out. 
5. The researcher in the room with you will be logging your responses.
